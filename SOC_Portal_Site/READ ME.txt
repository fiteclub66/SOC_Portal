How to start the system:
1. It is not fully deployed but to run the Flask server just start and run the file “app.py”

   1. Change the file paths of the update files as well as root accesses in order to run them
   2. NOTE: running app in debug mode, cron jobs will add twice
1. Be sure that the proper versions of Flask, WTForms, Python-Crontab and Python 3.6 are installed
2. Access the system through a separate stand-alone window as page sleep will interrupt timer
